<h1>Micro ReactTS Setup</h1>

<p>Hey! Thanks for looking at my micro React Typescript setup.</p>
<p>I wanted to create this because CRA and Nextjs are sometimes to heavy for the things I want to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to spin up a React app for testing, a sandbox, or to just try new things.</p>
<p>The commitment of an entire CRA is wild, and unecessary.</p>
<p>Please enjoy, if there are any problems, let me know. While its a small setup, reailstically there are always
    problems somewhere.</p>
